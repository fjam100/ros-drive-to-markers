README

1. Assumes pickle is installed for reading/writing to files (please install it if you don't already have it).
2. Note that since roslaunch runs in a different environment, the file may be saved some place other than the current working directory. Writing the full path in my code is a way to circumvent this, but fails when there are no write permissions. This issue doesn't arise if rosrun is used individually. In any case, I'm displaying the length of the scan data, which is very interesting.
3. You must add markers in rviz to see them
